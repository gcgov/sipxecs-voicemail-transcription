Tools

A number of software tools will be used to construct this system.  The
Python scripting language (http://www.python.org/) is used to write
the milter.  The ffmpeg command line utility (http://www.ffmpeg.org/)
is used to convert the sound file to the correct input format


Configuring Sendmail

Sendmail is the software that delivers mail from the server where
SipXecs runs to the destination mail host. The file
``/etc/mail/sendmail.mc`` should be configured like so:

   dnl #Mail filter
   INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`vrfilter', `S=inet:5000@localhost, T=C:5m;R:5m')dnl
   define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `vrfilter')dnl
   dnl#

Details concerning milter configuration are available at
https://www.milter.org/developers/installation. We create an entry for
a voice recognition filter called 'vrfilter' that listens on TCP port
5000 of the local machine.  The milter runs in its own process.
Various timeouts are configured (so the milter won't delay delivery
indefinitely).

Typically, you will need to run *make* in the ``/etc/mail`` folder in
order to convert the sendmail macros into a ``sendmail.cf``
configuration file, and then restart sendmail.  Now, sendmail will
attempt to connect to the milter listening on port 5000 and pass
outbound mail to it.


Installing libmilter

Install the Python libmilter module from PyPI.
I like to use Python virtual environments when building
systems. If you want to use virtualenv, you will need to ensure that
PocketSphinx and Sphinxbase are available in the milter Python
environment.  Make sure your virtual environment is active in the
shell where you build those libraries (see Building PocketSphinx
below).

Libmilter is written in pure Python, so installation is relatively
straightforward:

   (pyenv)[waldbiec@blackbox0 DEV ~]$ pip install python-libmilter



Building FFMPEG

If your distribution doesn't provide a package for the ffmpeg
command line tool, you can get the source and build it according to
the instructions.  I am using this tool to convert the original WAV
file to stereo at a sample rate 16000 Hz.  It may be possible to
configure SipXecs to produce the sound files in this format, in which
case conversion by the milter would be unnecessary.


Configuring the Recognizer
The recognizer code: vrmilter.py


Running the Milter

The milter is run as any standard Python script.  I have chosen to run
it using the *ForkFactory* mixin which causes a new subprocess to be
generated for each milter request.  I also decided that the milter
will listen on the localhost TCP port 5000 to match the sendmail
configuration we performed earlier.  In a production environment, you
would probably want to integrate the script into your system startup
scripts (e.g. ``/etc/init.d/``), but running the script from a shell
works fine for testing and debugging purposes.
